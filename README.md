# Fluttery Site Summaries

This app was developed as part of my Flutter tutorial series found on https://boehrsi.de/collections/flutter-app-development/. The app itself is functional and
the tutorial is meant for intermediate level developers. It tried to adhere to best practices and created an actual architecture during development, so the
initial understanding of the flow requires some knowledge of [Dart](https://dart.dev/), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and the
[BloC concept](https://bloclibrary.dev/).

Further information can be found on https://boehrsi.de. My blog posts are written in german, if interest for an english translation of the tutorial series is
given, feel free to create an issue / upvote an existing one and I will try to create an english version too.
